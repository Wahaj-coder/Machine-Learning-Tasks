#Elevvo Machine Learning Internship Projects
This repository contains the work completed during my Elevvo Machine Learning Internship, covering both fundamental concepts and industry-relevant techniques.
The projects includes regression, clustering, and classification tasks, applying multiple ML/DL algorithms and evaluating their performance.

##ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview
Student Score Prediction â€“ Simple Linear Regression to predict exam scores from study hours.
Customer Segmentation â€“ K-Means and DBSCAN clustering on mall customer data.
Forest Cover Type Classification â€“ Random Forest vs XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning.
Music Genre Classification â€“ Comparison of tabular ML models and CNN-based spectrogram classification.
Traffic Sign Classification â€“ Custom CNN vs MobileNetV2 for image classification.

##ðŸ›  Technologies & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn, XGBoost
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV

##ðŸ“Š Key Skills Learned
Data preprocessing & visualization
